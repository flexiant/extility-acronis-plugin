If you make any changes to the windows backup setup application you will need to build the project 
and copy the FCOAcronisWinbackupSetup.exe from the debug folder to scripts.

This is so it will be built along-side the perl script, 
made a public blob available to the api, 
and added to jade-utils for the MBE to access.

Best program to use the windows project for Macs is Xamarian Studio which it was developed in.
